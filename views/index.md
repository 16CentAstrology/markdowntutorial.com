Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It's written in what nerds like to
call "plaintext," which is exactly the sort of text you're used to writing. Plaintext
is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks (\*) and
backticks (\`).

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in
Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It's
quickly becoming the writing standard for [academics](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/markdown-the-syntax-you-probably-already-know/35295),
[scientists](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2012/12/13/a-call-for-scholarly-markdown/),
and [creative people](http://lifehacker.com/5943320/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-better-for-my-to+do-lists-and-notes).

Markdown is a format that requires a very gentle learning curve. It doesn't control
the font size, color, or type. All you have control over is the display of the text--
how lines are broken up, or the list order. And if you have ten minutes, we're
going to teach it.

In these lessons, you'll be given an introduction to a Markdown concept, and you'll
be asked to write something with that new knowledge.
